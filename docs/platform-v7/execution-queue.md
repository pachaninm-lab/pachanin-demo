# platform-v7 execution queue

## MASTER-TZ Execution Order

This is the real product execution sequence. The fallback smoke-slice loop is the
automation conveyor only — it does not represent product completion.

CURRENT: PR 5.6 Runtime Integration Tests

CURRENT ALLOWED:
- apps/web/tests/unit/platformV7RuntimeIntegration.test.ts

CURRENT CRITERIA:
- Integration tests exercise the full server-wrapper → service → persistence chain.
- Covers: money, document, bank-basis, release-workflow, dispute-settlement paths.
- Covers: idempotency duplicate replay, conflict handling, validation_error paths.
- Restricted areas remain blocked. Merge gate remains final authority.

DONE (MASTER-TZ checkpoints):
- Stage 3: RBAC / ACL / roles / access rights
- Stage 4: MoneyTree / Document Matrix / Bank Basis / Action Boundary / Final QA

- PR 5.3: Persistence Port Interfaces
- PR 5.4: DTO / Validation Schemas
- PR 5.1: Application Service Layer
- PR 5.5: Mock Persistence Adapter
- PR 5.2: Server Action Wrappers

DONE (autopilot smoke conveyor):
- baseline
- Runner Inline PR
- Runner Gate Fix
- Runner Opens PR
- Runner PR Permission Smoke

NEXT (strict order — each unlocked only after previous merges):
1. PR 5.1 Application Service Layer                 ← DONE
2. PR 5.5 Mock Persistence Adapter                  ← DONE
3. PR 5.2 Server Action Wrappers                    ← DONE
4. PR 5.6 Runtime Integration Tests                 ← CURRENT
5. PR 5.7 Final Stage 5 QA
6. External Adapter Emulators     (only after Stage 5 complete)
7. AI Integration Gateway         (only after runtime/adapters)
8. Product Entry / Onboarding     (only after runtime foundation)
9. Theme / Visual / Role Cockpit  (only after runtime binding)

RULES:
- One PR equals one narrow layer.
- Keep controlled-pilot / pre-integration status.
- No apps/landing. No broad UI/runtime/API/DB/lockfiles outside explicit SOT unlock.
- No production-ready claims. No fake-live claims.
- Fallback smoke conveyor continues independently and does not represent product completion.
