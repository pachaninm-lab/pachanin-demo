- Layer: Autopilot Full Loop Verification
- Allowed files:
  - docs/platform-v7/autopilot/**
  - docs/platform-v7/execution-queue.md
  - scripts/p7-autopilot-*.mjs
  - .github/workflows/platform-v7-autopilot-*.yml
- Success criteria:
  - selector, intake, executor dry-run, analyzer, safe-fix, merge gate, and state update are verified in one report;
  - report shows blocked state for unsafe scope;
  - report shows planned state for safe scope;
  - no product files are changed.
- Readiness remains 72%.

RULES:
- One PR equals one narrow layer.
- Keep controlled-pilot status.
- Keep this layer limited to autopilot docs, scripts, and matching autopilot workflows.
